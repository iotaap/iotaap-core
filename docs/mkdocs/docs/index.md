# IoTaaP Core Library

IoTaaP Core Library speeds your development by providing you simple to use functions for all IoTaaP board features.

## Core Library Reference

Our Core Library is object oriented C++ library made to be used with IoTaaP development hardware and PlatformIO ecosystem. Core Library easily integrates
with 3rd party libraries and resources in order to give you flexibility in development. 

!!! note "Core Library backward compatibility"
	Core Library might change in the future and you will be able to use specific library version by configuring it in platformio.ini library. 
    As our Core Library is community supported, various performance, security and usability improvements are expected, and we
    are giving our best to ensure that the most recent versions are backward compatible. More info regarding `platformio.ini` configuration
    can be found [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env_library.html#lib-deps).
